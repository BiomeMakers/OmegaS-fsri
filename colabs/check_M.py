"""check_M.py -- which factors of the Omega-S objective actually respond to the weights.

This is the measurement that decides how much the orientation of M matters in
practice, and it is the one behind the elasticity figures reported in the paper.
It needs no training, no previous-task data and no GPU: it reads the weights of
an already-downloaded model and measures, for each of the four factors of the
objective, its ELASTICITY with respect to the weights.

Elasticity is the relative change in a factor produced by a relative change in W
along a fixed random direction. It is dimensionless, so it is comparable across
factors, modules and models:

    elasticity ~ 0    the factor is inert; it cannot contribute gradient
    elasticity ~ 1    the factor responds proportionally

On Llama-3-8B we measure C, D and M at or below 1e-4 and Coex around 9e-3, which
is what the paper means when it says three of the four factors are inert and the
effect is carried by degree variance. Whether that holds on other models is
open. The script is here so that the claim can be checked rather than taken on
trust, and it prints its verdict either way: a result showing the factors LIVE
on some other model would narrow the claim, and that outcome is as informative
as the one we report.

Usage:

    python colabs/check_M.py                          # default: Llama-3-8B
    MODEL=Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B python colabs/check_M.py
    MODEL=/path/to/a/local/snapshot python colabs/check_M.py

The model must already be present in the local Hugging Face cache (or given as a
path). Nothing is downloaded. Results are written to check_M.json; please attach
that file to the replication report.
